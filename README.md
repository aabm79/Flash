# Introduction

Working 10.78 Flash Client files for Gesior 2012.    
Currently un-documented, but should be easy enough to get running for any savvy OT developer.

# Setup
1. Compile included TFS source with flash data changes.    
  (Alternatively, run a code compare against the current [TFS](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver) release.)
2. Copy content from [HTML](https://github.com/Leo32onGIT/TFS-Flash/tree/master/html) dir into working [Gesior 2012](https://github.com/gesior/Gesior2012/tree/TFS-1.0) installation.
2. Launch TFS server as per normal.
3. Launch flashlogin.php via php.     
  (Windows users can do this via the xampp shell or uniserver shell.)

You should now be able to login to your server through your Gesior 2012 based website.    

# Disclaimer

This is a proof-of-concept and won't be actively updated by myself.    
If you support the idea, generate interest for the [flash client to be officially supported](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver/issues/1570) by the TFS team.
